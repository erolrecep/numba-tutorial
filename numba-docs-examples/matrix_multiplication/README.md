# CUDA Matrix Multiplication with Shared Memory Optimization

This example demonstrates GPU-accelerated matrix multiplication using CUDA and Numba, showcasing the dramatic performance improvements achievable through shared memory optimization. It provides a comprehensive comparison between naive and optimized GPU implementations, along with CPU baselines, demonstrating fundamental parallel computing concepts and memory hierarchy exploitation.

## Mathematical Foundation

### Matrix Multiplication Algorithm

Matrix multiplication C = A × B involves computing each element C[i,j] as:

```
C[i,j] = Σ(k=0 to K-1) A[i,k] × B[k,j]
```

Where:
- **A**: M×K matrix (M rows, K columns)
- **B**: K×N matrix (K rows, N columns)
- **C**: M×N result matrix (M rows, N columns)

### Computational Complexity

**Time Complexity**: O(M × N × K)
- Each of the M×N output elements requires K multiply-add operations
- Total operations: 2×M×N×K (K multiplications + K additions per element)

**Space Complexity**: O(M×K + K×N + M×N)
- Memory for input matrices A, B and output matrix C

### Parallelization Strategy

Matrix multiplication is **embarrassingly parallel** at the element level:
- Each output element C[i,j] can be computed independently
- Perfect for GPU's SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) architecture
- Thousands of threads can work simultaneously on different elements

## Technical Implementation

### Algorithm 1: Naive GPU Implementation

```python
@cuda.jit
def naive_matmul(A, B, C):
    """
    Naive matrix multiplication kernel: C = A * B
    Each thread computes one element of the result matrix.
    """
    i, j = cuda.grid(2)

    if i < C.shape[0] and j < C.shape[1]:
        tmp = 0.0
        for k in range(A.shape[1]):
            tmp += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
        C[i, j] = tmp
```

**Characteristics:**
- **Thread Mapping**: One thread per output element C[i,j]
- **Memory Access**: All accesses to global memory (slow)
- **Memory Traffic**: High - each element access goes to global memory
- **Performance**: Limited by memory bandwidth, not compute capability

**Memory Access Pattern:**
```
Thread (i,j) accesses:
- A[i,0], A[i,1], ..., A[i,K-1]  (row i of A)
- B[0,j], B[1,j], ..., B[K-1,j]  (column j of B)
```

### Algorithm 2: Shared Memory Optimized Implementation

```python
@cuda.jit
def shared_memory_matmul(A, B, C):
    """
    Optimized matrix multiplication using shared memory tiling.
    Divides matrices into tiles that fit in shared memory.
    """
    # Shared memory arrays for tiles
    sA = cuda.shared.array(shape=(TILE_SIZE, TILE_SIZE), dtype=float32)
    sB = cuda.shared.array(shape=(TILE_SIZE, TILE_SIZE), dtype=float32)

    # Thread and block indices
    tx = cuda.threadIdx.x
    ty = cuda.threadIdx.y
    bx = cuda.blockIdx.x
    by = cuda.blockIdx.y

    # Global thread indices
    row = by * TILE_SIZE + ty
    col = bx * TILE_SIZE + tx

    # Accumulator for the result
    tmp = 0.0

    # Number of tiles needed to cover the K dimension
    num_tiles = (A.shape[1] + TILE_SIZE - 1) // TILE_SIZE

    # Loop over tiles
    for tile in range(num_tiles):
        # Load tile into shared memory
        if row < A.shape[0] and (tile * TILE_SIZE + tx) < A.shape[1]:
            sA[ty, tx] = A[row, tile * TILE_SIZE + tx]
        else:
            sA[ty, tx] = 0.0

        if (tile * TILE_SIZE + ty) < B.shape[0] and col < B.shape[1]:
            sB[ty, tx] = B[tile * TILE_SIZE + ty, col]
        else:
            sB[ty, tx] = 0.0

        # Synchronize to ensure all threads have loaded their data
        cuda.syncthreads()

        # Compute partial dot product using shared memory
        for k in range(TILE_SIZE):
            tmp += sA[ty, k] * sB[k, tx]

        # Synchronize before loading next tile
        cuda.syncthreads()

    # Write result to global memory
    if row < C.shape[0] and col < C.shape[1]:
        C[row, col] = tmp
```

## Shared Memory Optimization Deep Dive

### The Memory Hierarchy Challenge

GPU memory hierarchy (from fastest to slowest):
1. **Registers**: ~1 cycle latency, very limited capacity
2. **Shared Memory**: ~1-32 cycle latency, ~48KB per SM
3. **L1/L2 Cache**: ~32-200 cycle latency, hardware managed
4. **Global Memory**: ~200-800 cycle latency, several GB capacity

### Tiling Strategy

The shared memory algorithm uses **tiling** to exploit the memory hierarchy:

```
Matrix A (M×K)     Matrix B (K×N)
┌─────┬─────┐      ┌─────┬─────┐
│ A₀₀ │ A₀₁ │      │ B₀₀ │ B₀₁ │
├─────┼─────┤  ×   ├─────┼─────┤
│ A₁₀ │ A₁₁ │      │ B₁₀ │ B₁₁ │
└─────┴─────┘      └─────┴─────┘

Each tile is TILE_SIZE × TILE_SIZE (typically 16×16)
```

### Memory Access Optimization

#### Coalesced Memory Access:
```python
# Good: Consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
sA[ty, tx] = A[row, tile * TILE_SIZE + tx]
# Thread 0 accesses A[row, tile*16 + 0]
# Thread 1 accesses A[row, tile*16 + 1]
# Thread 2 accesses A[row, tile*16 + 2]
# ... (perfect coalescing)
```

#### Data Reuse:
```python
# Each element in shared memory is used TILE_SIZE times
for k in range(TILE_SIZE):
    tmp += sA[ty, k] * sB[k, tx]
# sA[ty, k] is reused by all threads in the same row
# sB[k, tx] is reused by all threads in the same column
```

### Synchronization Points

```python
cuda.syncthreads()  # Critical synchronization points
```

**Why synchronization is needed:**
1. **After loading**: Ensure all threads finish loading before computation
2. **Before next tile**: Ensure computation completes before overwriting shared memory

**Performance Impact:**
- Synchronization adds latency (~few cycles)
- But enables massive memory bandwidth savings
- Net effect: significant performance improvement

## Performance Analysis

### Theoretical Performance Limits

#### Memory Bandwidth Analysis:

**Naive Algorithm:**
```
Global memory accesses per element C[i,j]: 2K (K from A, K from B)
Total global memory accesses: M × N × 2K
Memory traffic: M × N × 2K × 4 bytes (float32)
```

**Shared Memory Algorithm:**
```
Global memory loads per tile: TILE_SIZE² × 2 (one tile from A, one from B)
Tiles needed: (M/TILE_SIZE) × (N/TILE_SIZE) × (K/TILE_SIZE)
Total global memory accesses: Much lower due to reuse
```

#### Arithmetic Intensity:

**Naive**: Low arithmetic intensity (memory-bound)
```
Operations per byte: 2K operations / (2K × 4 bytes) = 0.5 ops/byte
```

**Shared Memory**: Higher arithmetic intensity
```
Operations per byte: 2×TILE_SIZE³ operations / (2×TILE_SIZE² × 4 bytes) = TILE_SIZE/4 ops/byte
For TILE_SIZE=16: 4 ops/byte (8x improvement)
```

#### Performance Insights:

1. **Small Matrices**: GPU overhead dominates, limited speedup
2. **Medium Matrices**: GPU advantage emerges, shared memory helps
3. **Large Matrices**: Dramatic speedups, shared memory crucial
4. **Very Large Matrices**: Memory bandwidth becomes critical bottleneck

### GFLOPS Analysis

**GFLOPS Calculation:**
```python
total_operations = 2 * M * N * K  # Multiply-add operations
gflops = total_operations / (time_ms * 1e6)
```

**Typical Results:**
- **CPU**: 0.01-0.03 GFLOPS (limited by sequential execution)
- **GPU Naive**: 0.02-0.05 GFLOPS (memory bandwidth limited)
- **GPU Shared**: 0.03-0.08 GFLOPS (better memory utilization)

## Advanced CUDA Programming Concepts

### 1. Thread Block Configuration

```python
# Optimal configuration for shared memory algorithm
TILE_SIZE = 16  # 16×16 = 256 threads per block
block_size = (TILE_SIZE, TILE_SIZE)
blocks_per_grid_x = (N + TILE_SIZE - 1) // TILE_SIZE
blocks_per_grid_y = (M + TILE_SIZE - 1) // TILE_SIZE
blocks_per_grid = (blocks_per_grid_x, blocks_per_grid_y)
```

**Why TILE_SIZE = 16?**
- **Warp Size**: 32 threads per warp, 16×16 = 256 threads = 8 warps
- **Shared Memory**: 16×16×2×4 bytes = 2KB per block (well within 48KB limit)
- **Occupancy**: Good balance between threads and resource usage

### 2. Memory Coalescing Patterns

#### Coalesced Access (Good):
```python
# Consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
sA[ty, tx] = A[row, tile * TILE_SIZE + tx]
```

#### Strided Access (Bad):
```python
# Would cause memory bank conflicts
sA[tx, ty] = A[row, tile * TILE_SIZE + tx]  # Don't do this
```

### 3. Shared Memory Bank Conflicts

**Bank Configuration**: 32 banks, 4-byte words
```python
# No bank conflicts: different banks
sA[0, 0], sA[0, 1], sA[0, 2], ...  # Banks 0, 1, 2, ...

# Bank conflicts: same bank, different addresses
sA[0, 0], sA[1, 0], sA[2, 0], ...  # All bank 0 (if stride = 32)
```

**Our Implementation**: Carefully designed to avoid bank conflicts through proper indexing.

### 4. Occupancy Optimization

**Factors Affecting Occupancy:**
- **Threads per block**: 256 (16×16) is optimal for most GPUs
- **Shared memory usage**: 2KB per block is reasonable
- **Register usage**: Numba optimizes automatically
- **Block size**: Must be multiple of warp size (32)

## Implementation Best Practices

### 1. Bounds Checking

```python
# Always check array bounds
if row < C.shape[0] and col < C.shape[1]:
    C[row, col] = tmp

# Handle partial tiles at boundaries
if row < A.shape[0] and (tile * TILE_SIZE + tx) < A.shape[1]:
    sA[ty, tx] = A[row, tile * TILE_SIZE + tx]
else:
    sA[ty, tx] = 0.0  # Pad with zeros
```

### 2. Synchronization Strategy

```python
# Load data
cuda.syncthreads()  # Ensure all loads complete

# Compute using shared data
cuda.syncthreads()  # Ensure computation completes before next tile
```

### 3. Data Type Considerations

```python
# Use float32 for optimal GPU performance
A = A.astype(np.float32)
B = B.astype(np.float32)

# Shared memory declaration
sA = cuda.shared.array(shape=(TILE_SIZE, TILE_SIZE), dtype=float32)
```

### 4. Error Handling and Validation

```python
def validate_results(C_cpu, C_gpu_naive, C_gpu_shared, tolerance=1e-4):
    """Validate that all implementations produce consistent results."""
    naive_match = np.allclose(C_cpu, C_gpu_naive, rtol=tolerance, atol=tolerance)
    shared_match = np.allclose(C_cpu, C_gpu_shared, rtol=tolerance, atol=tolerance)
    return naive_match and shared_match
```

## Real-World Applications

    results = []
    for gpu_id in range(num_gpus):
        with cuda.gpus[gpu_id]:
            start_row = gpu_id * rows_per_gpu
            end_row = start_row + rows_per_gpu

            # Compute partial result on this GPU
            A_partition = A[start_row:end_row]
            C_partition = gpu_matmul_shared(A_partition, B)
            results.append(C_partition)

    # Concatenate results
